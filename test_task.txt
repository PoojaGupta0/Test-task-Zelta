    Title: Code Optimization for web_intercept.py

    Description:                    
    We need to optimize the code in the web_intercept.py to improve readability and maintainability without changing its functionality. 

    Task List:
    1. Remove unused imports.
    2. Those function intercept_json_playwright_old and intercept_json_playwright_multiple we are not calling anywhere but might you are using this function in older version of that package in future we can remove this.
    3. Remove the deprecated function set_json_to_page.
    4. Remove the deprecated function construct_handle_response
    5. Ensure consistent naming conventions for variables and functions.
    6. Remove redundant code blocks.
    7. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python.

Title: Add Unit Tests for web_intercept Module
    
    Objective: To add comprehensive unit tests for the functions in the web_intercept module to ensure that they work as expected and handle various scenarios correctly.

    Test Cases:

    test_request_json_playwright_success:
        Purpose: Test that the request_json_playwright function works successfully when provided with a valid URL that returns JSON data.
    
        Steps:
        Mock the Page object using MagicMock.
        Simulate a successful response with valid JSON data.
        Call the request_json_playwright function with the mocked objects.
        Assert that the response is not None.
    
    test_request_json_playwright_error:
        Purpose: Test that the intercept_json_playwright function handles error scenarios correctly.
        
        Steps:
        Mock the Page object using MagicMock.
        Simulate an error response by providing an invalid URL.
        Call the intercept_json_playwright function with the mocked objects.
        Assert that the response contains the expected error message.
        Custom Exception Handling: Ensure that the functions handle errors and exceptions gracefully, such as network errors, timeouts, and invalid JSON responses.

    Coverage: 
        Make sure that the test cases cover both success and error scenarios, including cases where the server may not return JSON data or when the URL is invalid.

Title: Implement Custom Exceptions for PlaywrightPlus

    Objective: To implement custom exception classes for the PlaywrightPlus module to provide more detailed and meaningful error handling.

    Custom Exceptions:

        1. PlaywrightPlusException:
            Base exception class with default values for status code, error code, error, and error message.
            Constructor allows customization of the error message.
            Provides methods to retrieve the error message and create a response dictionary.
            
        2. PlaywrightInterceptError (inherits from PlaywrightPlusException):
            Represents an error related to the interception of responses.
            Uses a specific error code and status code.
            Provides a customized error message.
            
        3. PlaywrightInterceptJsonError (inherits from PlaywrightPlusException):
            Represents an error when an empty JSON response is collected after calling a hidden API.
            Uses a specific error code and status code.
            Provides a customized error message.
            Usage: Implement the custom exceptions in the PlaywrightPlus module to raise and handle specific errors more effectively. Replace generic exceptions with these custom exceptions where appropriate.

    Documentation: 
        Update the module's documentation to include information about these custom exceptions, their usage, and the meaning of each error code.

    Testing: 
        Ensure that the custom exceptions are tested comprehensively to confirm that they raise and handle errors as expected.

    Review: 
        Please review the implementation of these custom exceptions and make sure they align with the error handling requirements and practices for the PlaywrightPlus module.

Title: Refactor Error Handling and JSON Detection Logic

    Objective: 
        Refactor the error handling and JSON detection logic in the intercept_json_playwright function to ensure that errors detected by json_detect_error are correctly included in the target_json result data.

    Scope:
        Currently, the code structure is such that json_detect_error is called after checking for target_json. This may lead to issues where errors detected by json_detect_error are not properly included in the result data.

        The objective is to refactor the code so that the error handling logic is consistent, and errors detected by json_detect_error are appropriately handled and included in the result.

    Proposed Changes:
        Modify the code to ensure that json_detect_error is called before checking for target_json.
